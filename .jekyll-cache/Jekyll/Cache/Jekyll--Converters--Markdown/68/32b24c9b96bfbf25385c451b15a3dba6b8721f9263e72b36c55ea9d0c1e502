<p>If you are interested in pursuing a M.S. or Ph.D. degree at UT with financial support, please send a formal, complete application to UT Graduate School. Otherwise, your case will not be forwarded to EECS for departmental consideration of admission. Also, you may check our EECS department website about our EECS graduate program.</p>

<p>Preference of funded positions will be given to Ph.D. applicants. An earned M.S. degree at the time of enrollment is generally required for Ph.D. positions; however, outstanding candidates with B.S. degree only may be considered for direct Ph.D. enrollment. If you want to apply for a Ph.D. position, you are encouraged to email me a copy of your resume that includes a list of your in-major courses and grades, overall GPA, publication list if any, GRE score, TOEFL score (for international applicants), and names of three references. However, please don’t ask me whether you will receive a financial aid in your initial emails to me. I simply cannot answer this question without a thorough evaluation of your background as well as other competitive candidates.</p>

<p>Also, I am accepting visiting scholars (preferrably with funding from your own government or other sources) in electric power engineering.</p>

<p>In your email, please use <em>“Graduate Applicant - Your Name”</em> or <em>“Postdoc Applicant - Your Name”</em> as the subject.</p>
