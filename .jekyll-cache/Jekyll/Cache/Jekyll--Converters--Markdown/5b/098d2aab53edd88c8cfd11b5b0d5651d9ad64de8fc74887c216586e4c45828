<p>Professor Li has been a faculty member since 2005 (James W. McConnell Professor in 2017, Professor in 2016, Associate Professor in 2011, Assistant Professor in 2005) in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) at The University of Tennessee at Knoxville (UTK). He is a Fellow of IEEE (Class of 2017). He is one of the original core faculty members of the NSF Engineering Research Center, CURENT, funded by NSF at $37.5 million in 10 years from 2011 to 2021. He is presently serving as the UTK Campus Director of CURENT and the lead for Large-scale Test Bed. He is the Director of the ENLITEN Lab. He is also an adjunct researcher at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). His current interests include renewable energy integration, demand response, distributed energy resources, energy markets, and power system computational methods.</p>

<p>Professor Li had worked at ABB Electrical System Consulting (ESC), a.k.a. ABB Consulting, in Raleigh, NC, from February 2001 to August 2005 as a Senior Engineer and then a Principal Engineer before joining UT. During his employment at ABB, he has been significantly involved first in power distribution system and then in power market analysis. In particular, he was the lead developer of GridView Releases 1.0 and 2.0. Presently, GridView is a major power-market simulator with a number of users at power utilities and Independent System Operators (ISOs), as well as being an internal consulting tool for ABB consultants. He had also worked as a part-time engineer at Electrical Distribution Design (EDD) Inc., Blacksburg, VA from 1998 to 2000 and an engineer intern at NARI (China) in 1997. He received his BSEE and MSEE degrees from Southeast University (China) in 1994 and 1997 respectively. He received his Ph.D. degree from Virginia Tech in 2001. He is a registered Professional Engineer (P.E.) in the state of North Carolina.</p>

<p>Professor Li is a Fellow of IEEE (Class of 2017), a Fellow of IET (formerly IEE, elected in December 2011), a Member of Sigma Xi - The Scientific Research Society. He will be the Editor-In-Chief of  IEEE Open Access Journal of Power and Energy, since January 2020. He serves as the Vice Editor-In-Chief of Journal of Modern Power Systems and Clean Energy (MPCE) by Springer from January 2019 to December 2019. His other editing service includes the following duties: an Editor of IEEE Transactions on Power Systems (since 2017), an Editor (2011-2017) and then Consulting Editor (since 2018) of IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy, an Editor of IEEE Power and Energy Society Letters (since 2011), a Guest Editor of IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid (2014-2015), a Guest Editor of IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics (2016-2018), a Guest Editor of IET Renewable Power Generation (2018), an Editorial Board Member of Journal of Modern Power Systems and Clean Energy (MPCE) by Springer, and an Editorial Board Member of CSEE Journal of Power and Energy Systems (by Wiley-IEEE). He is serveing or has served the IEEE PES PSOPE Committee as a Chair (2020-2021), Vice Chair (2018-2019) and Co-Vice Chair (2016-2017); the PSPI Committee as a Secretary (2010-2014) and Vice Chair (2014-2016); and the President of North America Chinese Power Professional Association (2013~2015). He has been a chair/organizer of numerous panel sessions at a number of international conferences.</p>

<p>Professor Li and his research team have received a number of recognitions (see his award list). As the Principal Investigator (PI), Prof. Li recieved the prestigious ‚ÄúR&amp;D 100 Award‚Äù in 2020 for the ‚ÄúCURENT LTB (Large-scale Test Bed)‚Äù project. In the same year, he also led another project ‚ÄúDCNNN‚Äù which received the ‚ÄúR&amp;D 100 Finalist‚Äù honor. In his professional society, he received 6 research-oriented awards (IET Fellow in 2011, IEEE Fellow in 2016, Best Paper Award in 2020 by Journal of Modern Power Systems and Clean Energy (IF=3.090) - as corresponding author, Prize Paper award by CSEE Journal of Power and Energy Systems (IF=3.115) in 2020,  Highly Cited Paper award by Applied Energy in 2019 - as corresponding author, and IEEE PES PSOPE Technical Committee Prize Paper Award in 2018 - as corresponding author), 4 Best Conference Papers (Top 5% papers at IEEE PES Genearl Meetings; 1 paper in 2015, 2 papers in 2016, and 1 paper in 2018), and 4 service-oriented awards (2015 IEEE PES Technical Committee Distinguished Service Award, 2017 Excellent Guest EIC of Journal of MPCE, 2017 Excellent Associate Editor of Journal of MPCE, 2018 IEEE PES ‚ÄúTechnical Committee of the Year‚Äù award - as Vice Chair of the PSOPE committee). At UTK, he reeived two teaching awards and several research awards. His graduate students have won several significant awards, such as winning the Best Student Poster Contests at IEEE PES conferences (Rui Bo: 2nd Place at PSCE09 and Huijuan Li: 1st Place at GM09) and CURENT Annual Industrial Conference (Qinran Hu in 2014 and Haoyu Yuan in 2015).</p>

<p>In his spare time, Dr. Li is best known as an expert player in three different sports/games (including two mind sports): a Tennessee top-10 ranked Table Tennis player (USATT peak rating: 1900+), a competitive chess player (USCF peak rating: 1600+, &gt;89.5% USCF players) and an online-5-Dan Go/Weiqi player. He is the Faculty Advisor of UTK Table Tennis club and Go club, and he coaches a chess class at a local Sunday-afternoon Chinese School with his chess students winning TN state scholastic champions.</p>
