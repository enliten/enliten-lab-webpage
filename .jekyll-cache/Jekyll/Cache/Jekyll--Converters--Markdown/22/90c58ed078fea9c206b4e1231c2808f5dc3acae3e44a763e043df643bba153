<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>The Another Market Simulator (AMS) is a Python-based power market simulation package which has been integrated into the CURENT large-scale testbed (LTB). AMS is the market module of the CURENT LTB for solving steady-state market clearing and scheduling problems.  The current version of AMS is capable of solving three types of problems: (1) security constrained unit commitment (SCUC), (2) security constrained economic dispatch (SCED), and (3) real-time ex-post pricing. The models in AMS are formulated and optimized with Gurobipy, and the simulation results can be outputted as .xslx files or figure plots based on usersâ€™ preferences. The following figure shows a sample of SCUC/SCED results plotted by AMS.</p>
